            <h6> The parameters used to monitor the quality of Dahi samples were physical (smell and taste, body and consistency, color and texture), 
              chemical (protein, fat, total solids, ash, acidity and pH) and microbiological (gram positive rods and cocci, total viable count, 
              coliform and mould count).Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding 
              rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to sit. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein)
               to tangle into solid masses, or curds.While stainless steel will give you the best possible results when it comes to setting curd, you can also use clay or earthen
                pot for the purpose. Many people also use bone China and ceramic bowls to set it.Yogurt is made from the fermentation of the lactose in milk by
                 the rod-shaped bacteria Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to produce lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yoghurt its texture and 
                 its characteristic acidic taste.Many Bulgarians claim it was accidentally discovered here around 4,000 years ago when nomadic tribes roamed the land. 
                 The nomads carried their milk in animal skins, .</h6>

            <h6>Milk is very nutritious and perhaps an indispensable food for human being. But in this area of industrialization, food habit of common people is changing. They are preferring moor healthy, delicious foods to fresh raw foods. Hence, milk is converted to various products. Yoghurt is one of them locally called Dahi. About 4% of the total milk produced in Bangladesh is used for the preparation of Dahi (Mustafa, 1997). Dahi is prepared by using mixed culture of Streptococcus lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus citrophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum etc. Like milk, Dahi is also very nutritious. It has been demonstrated that acid milk is somewhat digestible than normal milk. For some individuals, Dahi has a definite therapeutic value, especially who usually suffer from stomach and intestinal disorders. The use based on the assumption that the acid fermenting bacteria and lactose of milk are able to create conditions in the intestinal tract which are unfavourable for the growth of putrefactive bacteria and thereby prevents the formation of gas and a condition known as 'autointoxication'. Yoghurt is also effective in lowering the blood cholesterol level. Following this discovery, considerable amount of L. acidophilus were distributed in the form of a milk culture of the organism. If acidophilus therapy is to be of any value, large number of viable cells of a readily implantable strain of the organism must be consumed daily, along with a suitable carbohydrate such as lactose or dextrin. Presumably these carbohydrates are effective because they are absorbed from the tract fairly slowly, thus remaining available longer as food for the lactobacilli (Foster et al., 1958).

              I’m sure Saag Paneer (spinach and paneer) which is a standard in Indian restaurants in most “western” countries, is more well known.
              This dish is made with peas instead of spinach and the cubes of paneer (fresh Indian cheese) are cooked with the peas and a tomato sauce which has a beautifully light, silky texture.
              Because of the way the spices are cooked into the dish, it has an elegant and complex flavor.
              Serve with rice and, if you like a couple other veggie dishes such as a nice Dal and a spicy potato dish to make a full Indian vegetarian feast !
            I’ve learned quite a few interesting techniques through Indian recipes. 
              One being the way to start the dish off with onions and usually garlic and ginger. 
              Instead of just “sweating” or “browning” for a few minutes, the onion mixture is cooked slowly for about 15 minutes and each time they start to stick you add a couple spoonfuls of water. 
              The final results give you a very deep flavored, almost caramelized base for your dish. 
              I now often use this method in other European dishes.
